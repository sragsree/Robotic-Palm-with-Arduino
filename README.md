# Biomorphic Robotic Palm

This a robotic palm built with low cost components that simulates all the gestures of a human hand. It includes two modules mainly

  - A transmitter module with Flex Sensors on a Glove to be worn by user.
  - A Receiver module that receives the data and replicates the hand guestures.

The communication between the two modules was achieved wirelessly using ZigBee.
